This project is comprised of 6 html files pertaining to 6 individual pages of a consruction website.
The website includes feature such as interactive DOM events, charts and hover-over elements.

Web pages index is as follows:

project_page1.html: Homepage
project_page2.html: Statistics page
project_page3.html: Services page
project_page4.html: Client login page
project_page5.html: Budget estimate page
project_page6.html: Gallery page

The homepage is called project_page1.html and should thus be opened first.

There are 2 CSV files which provide the charts data for pages 1 and 3 (data.csv relates to page 3, 
and client.csv for page 1). There are also two other charts built on arrays in pages 2 and 5. 

There is a subfolder named "siteimages" which contains almost all of the images apart from the 
website logo which is in the parent folder. 

Microsoft Edge or Firefox should be used for best results and interactivity. For reasons still 
unknown yet thoroughly explored, the CSV-related charts fail to load on Chrome but load on Edge 
and Firefox perfectly. There is no issue with loading array-related charts on any browsers.

There is another minor issue with the gallery flip images on page 6 only when using Firefox in that 
when hovered over and flipped, the text is not displayed on the back of the image. This issue does 
not occur with any other browser.

The website should be ran while using the Python web server in the same folder to faciliate D3.js 
elements and to maximise interactive experience. Go to the project folder location on the anaconda 
command prompt and type "Python -m http.server". Leave the server running in the background. 

Thank you
